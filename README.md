Voice Chat interface to [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) in [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io)


This app is largely based on code by [Yeyu Huang](https://medium.com/@wenbohuang0307) published in an 
[article in Level Up Coding](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/i-created-a-voice-chatbot-powered-by-chatgpt-api-here-is-how-6302d555b949)
with some changes to fix dependency issues, use secrets.toml, and autoplay audio response.

To get bokeh stream events and bokeh to both be happy at once, I had to downgroade bokeh Python package.

I also replaced the recording icon with https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mic-Animation.gif
